# CUBIT BRAND

# Product Brief
The CUBIT Impact Cloud is an impact management software that helps the sustainability office and supply chain managers at food & agriculture companies plan, implement, measure, report, and verify environmental outcomes across their entire value chain so they can meet their carbon emissions and nature-based targets.

Unlike existing tools that only support self-reporting and verification, CUBIT also supports third-party verification of projects and standards powered by blockchain technology that logs data at every step of the project which leads to a better sustainable, traceable, and transparent management and collaboration across your supply chain.
